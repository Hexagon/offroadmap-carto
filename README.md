# Offroadmap Carto

![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/master/preview.png)

These are the CartoCSS map stylesheets for the Standard map layer on [offroadmap.org](https://www.offroadmap.org/). This project is forked from [openstreetmap-carto](https://raw.github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto).

These stylesheets can be used in your own cartography projects, and are designed
to be easily customised. They work with [Kosmtik](https://github.com/kosmtik/kosmtik)
 and also with the command-line [CartoCSS](https://github.com/mapbox/carto) processor.

# Installation

You need a PostGIS database populated with OpenStreetMap data along with auxillary shapefiles.

Follow instructions at [openstreetmap-carto](https://raw.github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto), which is more likely to be updated.

# Versioning

This project follows a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning system. In the context of a
cartographic project you can expect the following:

* PATCH: When a patch version is released, there would be no reason not to
  upgrade. PATCH versions contain only bugfixes e.g. stylesheets won't compile,
  features are missing by mistake, etc.
* MINOR: These are routine releases and happen every 2-5 weeks. They will
  contain changes to what's shown on the map, how they appear, new features
  added and old features removed. They may rarely contain changes to assets i.e.
  shapefiles and fonts but will not contain changes that require software or
  database upgrades.
* MAJOR: Any change the requires reloading a database, or upgrading software
  dependencies will trigger a major version change.
